# Changelog

## v1.0.0

Extracted `wxt/storage` into it's own package, `@wxt-dev/storage`! It's still shipped inside WXT and accessible via `wxt/storage`, but now other, non-WXT projects can use the storage wrapper and we can make breaking changes to the API separately.

[Read the docs](https://wxt.dev/storage.html) for more details.
